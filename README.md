# Hybrid
Hybrid is a very simple and lightweight Hybrid framework for Android and iOS.

By the way,iOS demo is still in development by the future me...

If you are an Android developer, I have written a blog called [论移动端Hybid开发](http://www.cnblogs.com/wytings/p/6216340.html) about this project .

Threre is a demo web in `assests` for Hybrid test,you may need some basic **JavaScript** knowledge to read `hybrid.js` which only contains about one hundred lines of JS code.

**Any suggestions are welcomed!**
